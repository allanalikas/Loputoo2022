# ARX command-line-interface

The aim of this thesis is to compare and analyse three data anonymization softwares - ARX, Amnesia, Anonimatron - and integrate the software with the best results with the software that is developed in the Health Sense project. The author put together 10 criteria using ISO-9421 standard and characteristics that were important for the Health Sense project. For the purpose of comparing the different softwares, the author compiled 3 sets of different input data to perform the anonyimization process.
